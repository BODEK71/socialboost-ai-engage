        "content": "X platform (formerly Twitter) remains one of the most important communication channels for brands, influencers and content creators. However, according to our latest research, as much as 80% of all content published on this platform never reaches even 10% of its potential reach. Why is this happening? We conducted an in-depth analysis of over 250,000 posts published in the last 6 months to discover patterns and factors determining success or failure of content on X."

        "subtitle": "Five Key Factors Determining Reach on X",
        "content": "1. The first 15 minutes are crucial\nOur research has shown that the X algorithm largely makes decisions about further content promotion based on engagement in the first 15 minutes after publication. Posts that didn't receive significant engagement during this period have only a 2% chance of later achieving wide reach.\n\n2. \"Cold start\" is the biggest obstacle\nThe biggest challenge, especially for new accounts or content published by smaller brands, is the so-called \"cold start\". Without an initial impulse of engagement, even the most valuable content remains practically invisible.\n\n3. Credibility signals are more important than ever\nThe X algorithm increasingly favors content published by accounts with high credibility levels. Key signals are account history, previous engagement levels, and most importantly - the quality of interactions with the content.\n\n4. Invisible thematic bubbles\nWe discovered that X creates \"invisible thematic bubbles\", grouping users by interests and engagement history. Breaking through to new thematic bubbles is extremely difficult without a strategic approach.\n\n5. Interaction multiplier effect\nOur analyses showed a strong correlation between the diversity of interaction types and reach. Posts that generate diverse types of engagement (comments, retweets, likes, saves) have up to 600% greater reach than content with one dominant type of reaction."

The key is:\n- Strategic building of the first wave of engagement\n- Creating content in a way that stimulates diverse interactions\n- Systematic building of account credibility\n- Use of advanced analytical tools for optimization"
